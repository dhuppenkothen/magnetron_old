Downloading Magnetron
======================

You can find *Magnetron* as a git repository at its `bitbucket address <https://bitbucket.org/dhuppenkothen/transientdict/>`_.
Use ::
git clone https://dhuppenkothen@bitbucket.org/dhuppenkothen/transientdict.git

to clone the repository to your local disc, or set up your ssh client.

Requirements
=============

*Magnetron* requires a number of packages, as listed below:

* `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_
* `scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_
* `emcee <http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/>`_
* `acor <https://github.com/dfm/acor>`_
* `triangle <https://github.com/dfm/triangle.py>`_
* (`dnest <https://github.com/eggplantbren/DNest3>`_ if you want to play around on branch ``dnest``.)
If it breaks because of a failed import, I've probably forgotten something.


Installing Magnetron
=====================

There's currently no way to install *Magnetron* as such; it isn't a full-fledged *python* module, just some scripts.
This may be implemented in the future. Use at your own peril.

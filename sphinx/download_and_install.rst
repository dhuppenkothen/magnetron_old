Downloading Magnetron
======================

You can find *Magnetron* as a git repository at its `bitbucket address <https://bitbucket.org/dhuppenkothen/transientdict/>`_.
Use ::
    git clone https://dhuppenkothen@bitbucket.org/dhuppenkothen/transientdict.git
to clone the repository to your local disc, or set up your ssh client.

Installing Magnetron
=====================

There's currently no way to install *Magnetron* as such; it isn't a full-fledged *python* module, just some scripts.
This may be implemented in the future. Use at your own peril.
